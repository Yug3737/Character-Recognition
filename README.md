# Character Recognition Models
- This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python without the use of higher-level frameworks like Pytorch and TensorFlow.
- The only libraries used are Numpy, OpenCV, Pickle, Matplotlib and Flask.
- Accuracy obtained was 95% with this English Handwritten Characters Dataset: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset?resource=download)
