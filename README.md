# Character Recognition Models
- This project implements 2 neural networks from scratch in Python without the use of higher-level frameworks like Pytorch and TensorFlow.
- The only libraries used are Numpy, OpenCV, Pickle, Matplotlib and Flask.
- Digits_Recognition.ipynb recognizes digits 0-9 with an accuracy of 97% on average.
- Letters_Recognition.ipynb recognizes letters A-Z and a-z with an accuracy of 75% on average.
- A detailed report on the Project is in progress.
- Here is the link for the pickle binary files for the trained model. Before using them make sure to copy the respective model into your python file, since Pickle needs to see the class before it can load the trained object.
